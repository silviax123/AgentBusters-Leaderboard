Here are both documents:\n\n---\n\n# **DELIVERABLE 1: MEMORANDUM (PDF Format)**\n\n---\n\n## **MEMORANDUM**\n\n---\n\n**TO:** Administrative Services Staff\n\n**FROM:** Administrative Services Manager\n\n**DATE:** January 27, 2025\n\n**SUBJECT:** Tentative Community Cleanup Schedule \u2013 Volunteer Coordination and Customer Service Enhancement\n\n---\n\n### **PURPOSE**\n\nThis memo is to inform all Administrative Services staff of the new Tentative Cleanup Schedule, effective April 1, 2025. This schedule has been developed to improve our blight remediation efforts and enhance customer service. Please familiarize yourself with this schedule so you can effectively inform volunteers and respond to community inquiries.\n\n---\n\n### **BACKGROUND**\n\nAs you are aware, our community population has decreased steadily over the last 10 years, and eliminating blight remains a priority for our agency. Historically, our cleanup crews have faced significant challenges due to understaffing and the absence of a formal process. When the office received calls about illegal dumping, requests were simply added to a list and addressed in the order received. Unfortunately, crews were often called away to address issues in different locations and would never return to complete their original assignments. This approach left many jobs unfinished and resulted in dissatisfied residents.\n\n---\n\n### **NEW ROTATING SCHEDULE**\n\nTo address these challenges, General Services employees have been assigned to clean up debris following a structured, rotating schedule. The city has been divided into four sections, and crews will concentrate their efforts in one section per week on a rotating basis:\n\n**Section 1 \u2192 Section 2 \u2192 Section 3 \u2192 Section 4 \u2192 (repeat)**\n\nThis rotating approach will allow for concentrated cleanup efforts in specific areas each week. Over time, this consistent attention will remediate blight to a point where there is less debris to clear during each cycle.\n\nThe attached schedule covers the period from **April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026**.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Beginning in November, the snow season commences. All dates from November through mid-March are tentative and subject to change based on weather conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **VOLUNTEER COORDINATION**\n\nVolunteers have expressed a desire to assist our crews with area cleanups by picking up light trash and debris. When volunteers call the office to inquire about participation opportunities, please:\n\n1. Refer to the attached Tentative Cleanup Schedule\n2. Inform them of the dates when crews will be working in their area of interest\n3. Provide them with the section number and corresponding week\n4. Remind them that schedules may shift due to weather or emergencies\n\nAn Excel version of the schedule is attached for easy reference and sharing with volunteers.\n\n---\n\n### **CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCEMENT**\n\nThis new schedule will significantly improve our customer service capabilities. When residents call to report complaints about debris or illegal dumping, Administrative staff will now be able to:\n\n- Identify which section of the city the complaint is located in\n- Provide the caller with an estimated timeframe for abatement based on the rotating schedule\n- Set realistic expectations for when crews will address their concerns\n\nThis proactive communication will help rebuild trust with our community and reduce frustration among residents.\n\n---\n\n### **SCHEDULE DISRUPTIONS \u2013 EMERGENCIES AND SEVERE WEATHER**\n\nPlease be aware that the cleanup schedule may be disrupted due to emergencies or severe weather conditions. In such cases, the following protocols will apply:\n\n1. **TEMPORARY SHIFT:** Crews may be temporarily reassigned to another area to address urgent situations or may be unable to work due to inclement weather.\n\n2. **RETURN TO ORIGINAL LOCATION:** Once the emergency is resolved or weather conditions improve, crews will return to the original scheduled location to complete any unfinished work, provided time permits within the scheduled week.\n\n3. **RESCHEDULING MISSED AREAS:** If a section cannot be completed during its scheduled week, that area will be prioritized during the next rotation cycle. Staff should note any missed areas and communicate this to affected residents and volunteers.\n\n4. **COMMUNICATION:** Please keep residents and volunteers informed of any schedule changes. When possible, provide updated timeframes for when crews will return to their area.\n\n---\n\n### **ATTACHMENTS**\n\n1.

Here are both documents:\n\n---\n\n# **DELIVERABLE 1: MEMORANDUM (PDF Format)**\n\n---\n\n## **MEMORANDUM**\n\n---\n\n**TO:** Administrative Services Staff\n\n**FROM:** Administrative Services Manager\n\n**DATE:** January 27, 2025\n\n**SUBJECT:** Tentative Community Cleanup Schedule \u2013 Volunteer Coordination and Customer Service Enhancement\n\n---\n\n### **PURPOSE**\n\nThis memo is to inform all Administrative Services staff of the new Tentative Cleanup Schedule, effective April 1, 2025. This schedule has been developed to improve our blight remediation efforts and enhance customer service. Please familiarize yourself with this schedule so you can effectively inform volunteers and respond to community inquiries.\n\n---\n\n### **BACKGROUND**\n\nAs you are aware, our community population has decreased steadily over the last 10 years, and eliminating blight remains a priority for our agency. Historically, our cleanup crews have faced significant challenges due to understaffing and the absence of a formal process. When the office received calls about illegal dumping, requests were simply added to a list and addressed in the order received. Unfortunately, crews were often called away to address issues in different locations and would never return to complete their original assignments. This approach left many jobs unfinished and resulted in dissatisfied residents.\n\n---\n\n### **NEW ROTATING SCHEDULE**\n\nTo address these challenges, General Services employees have been assigned to clean up debris following a structured, rotating schedule. The city has been divided into four sections, and crews will concentrate their efforts in one section per week on a rotating basis:\n\n**Section 1 \u2192 Section 2 \u2192 Section 3 \u2192 Section 4 \u2192 (repeat)**\n\nThis rotating approach will allow for concentrated cleanup efforts in specific areas each week. Over time, this consistent attention will remediate blight to a point where there is less debris to clear during each cycle.\n\nThe attached schedule covers the period from **April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026**.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Beginning in November, the snow season commences. All dates from November through mid-March are tentative and subject to change based on weather conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **VOLUNTEER COORDINATION**\n\nVolunteers have expressed a desire to assist our crews with area cleanups by picking up light trash and debris. When volunteers call the office to inquire about participation opportunities, please:\n\n1. Refer to the attached Tentative Cleanup Schedule\n2. Inform them of the dates when crews will be working in their area of interest\n3. Provide them with the section number and corresponding week\n4. Remind them that schedules may shift due to weather or emergencies\n\nAn Excel version of the schedule is attached for easy reference and sharing with volunteers.\n\n---\n\n### **CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCEMENT**\n\nThis new schedule will significantly improve our customer service capabilities. When residents call to report complaints about debris or illegal dumping, Administrative staff will now be able to:\n\n- Identify which section of the city the complaint is located in\n- Provide the caller with an estimated timeframe for abatement based on the rotating schedule\n- Set realistic expectations for when crews will address their concerns\n\nThis proactive communication will help rebuild trust with our community and reduce frustration among residents.\n\n---\n\n### **SCHEDULE DISRUPTIONS \u2013 EMERGENCIES AND SEVERE WEATHER**\n\nPlease be aware that the cleanup schedule may be disrupted due to emergencies or severe weather conditions. In such cases, the following protocols will apply:\n\n1. **TEMPORARY SHIFT:** Crews may be temporarily reassigned to another area to address urgent situations or may be unable to work due to inclement weather.\n\n2. **RETURN TO ORIGINAL LOCATION:** Once the emergency is resolved or weather conditions improve, crews will return to the original scheduled location to complete any unfinished work, provided time permits within the scheduled week.\n\n3. **RESCHEDULING MISSED AREAS:** If a section cannot be completed during its scheduled week, that area will be prioritized during the next rotation cycle. Staff should note any missed areas and communicate this to affected residents and volunteers.\n\n4. **COMMUNICATION:** Please keep residents and volunteers informed of any schedule changes. When possible, provide updated timeframes for when crews will return to their area.\n\n---\n\n### **ATTACHMENTS**\n\n1.
